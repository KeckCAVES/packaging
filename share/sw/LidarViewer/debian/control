Description: Application for visualizing and measuring 3D point cloud data
 LiDAR Viewer is an application for visualizing and measuring 3D point cloud
 data, such as that collected via terrestrial or airborne LiDAR surveys. The
 software was developed to enable analysis of multi-billion-point lidar data
 sets without requiring binning, sub-sampling, decimation, or digital surface
 modeling.
