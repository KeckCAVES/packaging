Description: Vrui Tele-collaboration Infrastructure - Runtime
 The Collaboration Infrastructure is a framework for the development of
 collaborative immersive applications between multiple sites, based on a
 client-server architecture. Any number of clients can dynamically connect to
 a central collaboration server to participate in a collaborative session.
 While connected, clients see representations of the viewers and input devices
 of all other connected clients, can see audio and/or 2D or 3D video from other
 clients supporting those options, and can use shared annotation tools.
 .
 This package contains the runtime library files needed to run software
 using Vrui with the tele-collaboration infrastructure.
